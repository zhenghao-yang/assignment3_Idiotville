Information Architect: Zhenghao Yang

1. Decide what commonality the three students share. The 3 students selected all have several outstanding professional experiences or extracurricular activities, which I found impressive and inspiring.

2. Gather and modify content used for this webpage. All information comes from the “work history” section of their individual pages, with selection, modification and rearrangement.

3. Finalize the overall layout of the pages(header, backgrounds, navigation, typeface families, etc.).



Designer: Yidi Fan

1. Implement all the best practices and patterns for web design discussed in lectures(CRAP principles, Z/F patterns, readability and typography).

2. Reasonably modify and alter existing templates available to suit out content and present a sense of professionalism.



Coder: Yuanzhuo Wang

1. Ensure the quality of coding and modify the template we use to suit our content.

2. Factor out common elements using PHP includes.

3. Install the JS features.


This website utilizes a clean-looking template from bootstrap, with modifications. Our intention was to present an artifully simple yet professional design so that our pages suit the theme and the content(students with entrepreneurial insight and professional experiences). The home page contains an accordion created by JavaScript which provides a brief intro for each of the students. In addition, the navigation bar also has a user-friendly feature generated from JavaScript. When the viewer scrolls down the page, the navigation bar would disappear. However, the navigation will be shown again on the very top of the page whenever the viewer tries to scroll up to indicate where the user is.
