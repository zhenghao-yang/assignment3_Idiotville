              <h2 class='thesis'>Alejandro Abreu</h2>
              <p class='main'>Alejandro Abreu was born on September 6th, 1995. He was born in Monte Sinai hospital in Manhattan, and a few months later moved to the Bronx where he currently resides. He's from New York City, more specifically, the Bronx. As a youth, he was very active and in love with sports. He spent most of my time at the park or at the gym either playing baseball or basketball. He attended the P.S 220 for elementary school and later moved on the school for Applied Mathematics and Technology, AAMT, for middle school. At AAMT, he played basketball and ran track for the school team. After completing middle school, he moved on and attended high school at A Philip Randolph High School Campus. In high school, he was rejected from joining the varsity baseball team which led him to pursue other sports. This led him to playing Varsity Lacrosse and Bowling. He graduated from A Philip Randolph in Spring 2013. He was accepted to various university but none call out to him like the one that he currently attends. At the moment, He is a senior at the University of Rochester pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is anticipated to graduate from the University of Rochester in May 2018. In his lifetime he has worked in about 5 different location varying from a gym to a school.</p>
