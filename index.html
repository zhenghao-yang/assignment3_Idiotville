<!--This is just my very first rough idea, I'd like to talk to you guys and see how you think about it. In particular, I would like to discuss with you regarding the content to be delivered on this page.-->

<!-- The students to be selected in each student page are yet to be determiend, but hopefully they will be the 3 of us in the city team. 
Also, since the nature of this assignment is nothing more than a more advanced version of our previous assignment 2, I will give priority to the design and the layout, and I have a reason for that. Last time we were focusing on displaying a clear and consistent presentation, which is indeed critical. 
But on the other hand, we did lack eye-catching elements and a sense of professional visual design. Therefore, this time I seek to implement a simple, light-weight but artful presenting style, for example, one that looks like the MUJI style. To achieve that, we'll meet and test a number of possible layouts and combinations together. (time tbd)-->

 
<!--Directions for designerï¼š
 	1. Please look through a number of templates online and get a sense of what I'm looking for (like the designs of Apple and Muji, in essence, clean, artifully simple but not low-tier).
 	2. I would like to reduce the number of actual photos and only use them in the gallery of the home page because having too many of them in our page can be disturbing. That might leave you more workload on the rest of the pages, because we'll be solely counting on the quality of your design, I'll work with you to think about how to present expressively without making the pages dull.-->

<!--Directions for coder
	1. Please techinically ensure the quality of our pages. I suppose this time instead of a slideshow, we might want to see how will the gallery feature work, hope this won't be a problem for you, but again this change is subject to change as well.
	2. If possible, please assist the designer in terms of css, because trying to implement a professional style may require more work than we expect.-->
