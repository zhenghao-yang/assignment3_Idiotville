            </a>The first job that he obtained was here at the University of Rochester as a Building Manager at the Goergen Athletic Center. As a building manager at the Goergen Athletic Center, his main responsibilities include ensuring the safety of over 300 students and faculty members using the athletic facility. Building Managers take more than 3 tours a shift around the gym in order to ensure safety and proper usage of the equipment. In addition, a Building Manager is tasked with the responsibility of selling and promoting various membership packages. Finally, he also provided information of building and recreational activities to interested potential and active gym members over the phone or in person.</p>

          <p>He has previously worked with Upward bound as tutor. Upward Bound main focus is to provide high school students with the resources and support they need to get to and through college. As a tutor for Upward Bound, he improved on his communication skills by being responsible for tutoring high school students individually and in small groups who struggled in math. He ensured that every student receives his undivided attention and grasp the material in order to complete their work. When not tasked with tutoring students, he completed an excel spreadsheet on students personal information. Tutoring for Upward Bound has given him some experience in office space environment.</p>

          <p>In addition, he joined the Minority Male Leadership Association, MMLA, during his junior year at the University of Rochester. Joining MMLA gave him the opportunity to provide tutoring and support to male students in Public School 19 in Rochester, NY. The graduation rate in Rochester, NY is considerably low compared to other parts of the United States. The mission was to show students that the association was in the same position as them and the members of MMLA were able to overcome the obstacles that they may be going through themselves. He would go to Public School 19 twice a week, and work a group of three students. He was tasked with sitting in their classes and helping them with their work that they did not understand. He would also answer questions they had about his high school and college experience to the best of his abilities. Till this day, he tried to keep in contact with the students that he worked with at Public School 19. He hopes to provide the scholars in SEO program with the same support that he was able to provide to Luis Avila, Jordan Fletcher, and Thomas Brown at public school 19.</p>

          <p>During the summer, he has been working at the 92Y Camps in New York City as a Camp Counselor. The job was from 8 in the morning till 5 pm in the afternoon. The campers which he was in charge of were heading into fifth or sixth graders. His camp group consisted of 10 to 15 kids throughout the summer. The day would start with counselor heading to their bus site and waiting for their campers to arrive. Once you have gathered all your campers, the counselors would load the buses and head to the camp grounds which is about 30 to 45 minutes away from New York City. Throughout the bus rides, one would entertain the campers by providing them with cheers. As a Camp Counselor, his job was to ensure kids were not only safe but having a fun time at camp. He would participate in all activities that the kids were involved in. They would participate in activities such as basketball, baseball, lacrosse, cooking, and painting. Throughout the week, he would supervise basketball activities as well as baseball. However, occasionally he was switched depending on how many people were available. Throughout the summer the kids had four trips, two overnights and two late trips. During the final week of camp, kids were taken away to sleep away camp for the week where they compete in Color Wars. He had the honor of being the team captain for the Blue team two years in a row. Unfortunately, both the years he served as team captain his team ended up losing.</p>
