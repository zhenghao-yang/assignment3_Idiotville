            </a>During the summer of his freshman year, he worked for Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited; one of ExxonMobil's Upstream affiliates in Nigeria. Here, he was a member of the offshore field redevelopments', slot addition and riser repairs project team and he assisted in making feasibility reports for scheduled field redevelopment projects. He performed thorough reconciliation of materials in order to ensure that materials left over at the end of production jobs were accurately entered into the system and returned to their appropriate storage locations. During his time with the team, he was opportune to visit fabrication yards, where he witnessed the production of surfer ladders, prior to their installment offshore. He also participated in the Factory Acceptance test of a wellhead control panel, prior to its installation on a platform offshore.</p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>-->

            <p>In his sophomore year, he had the opportunity to intern in the Technology Advisory unit of KPMG Nigeria, where he worked as a member of the project implementation team managing Fidelity Bank Nigeria’s core banking platform upgrade. On this engagement, he tracked issues experienced by the bank staff nationwide during simulations of the new platform, and collaborated with the bank’s technical team to ensure the issues were resolved within the required timeframe. He also prepared project assessment reports, for the project team as well as the Bank's Executive board, to keep them up to speed with the project’s progress. Overall, he learned how to work in a deadline-oriented environment, enhanced his collaborative skills, became adept in the use of Microsoft Excel as a tool for data analytics.</p>

            <p>In the summer of his Junior year, he worked as a research fellow in the University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics as a part of the Xerox Engineering Fellows Program. He assisted Dr. Roman Sobolewski and his team with their research on terahertz photonics and nano device characterization. Over the course of the fellowship, he performed experiments to explore the interaction between carbon nanotube samples and lasers within the Terahertz frequency range and he really enjoyed it. With the data obtained from these experiments, he calculated necessary parameters such as the conductivity, absorption coefficient and permittivity of the samples using MATLAB. However, considering the relatively short (8 weeks) duration of the program, he was only able to reach a preliminary conclusion. This prompted him to sign up for the Semiconductor Devices advanced elective, and to begin his Independent study in terahertz photonics in the fall semester of his senior year, in order to further develop his research and analytical skills, and to assist the team in fully understanding their samples, and discovering potential ground-breaking applications for them in industries ranging from security to medicine.</p>
